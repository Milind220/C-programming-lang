A record of my solutions for the exercises included in 'The C Programming Language' book, by Brian W. Kerningham and Dennis M. Ritchie. 

> Note: I only intend to solve about 50% of the problems included in this book. Many of the exercises are repetitve, with only minor differences from the previous exercises, and so I have skipped them (at least for the moment).
